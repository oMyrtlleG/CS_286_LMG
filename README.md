The RAG-powered Learning Material Generator for PDFs is an innovative project developed as part of CS 286: Natural Language Understanding. This machine problem addresses the need for efficient and tailored educational resources by leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques.
The primary functionality of the generator allows users to upload multiple PDFs related to a specific topic of their choosing. Upon uploading, the program performs a series of key operations:
1.	**Text Extraction and Cleaning**: It begins by extracting text from the uploaded PDFs, followed by a cleaning process to ensure the data is free from extraneous information and formatted for processing.
2.	**Text Chunking and Vectorization**: The cleaned text is then divided into manageable chunks and converted into corresponding vectors using embedding techniques, which enhances retrieval effectiveness during the information extraction phase.
3.	**Information Retrieval and Text Generation**: By utilizing an API call integrated with Gemini 2.5 Flash, the program retrieves relevant information and generates cohesive and informative text that aligns with the user's selected topic.
4.	**Comprehensive Learning Material Creation**: Finally, the generated text is collated to produce a comprehensive learning material guide, providing users with a well-structured resource tailored to their educational needs.
   
The RAG-powered Learning Material Generator represents a significant advancement in personalized learning tools, facilitating a streamlined approach for educators and learners to access customized content. By combining automated extraction, modern embedding strategies, and intelligent text generation, this project aims to enhance the learning experience and promote effective knowledge acquisition.
